      <p class="intro_blurb">Denver is known for its dog-friendly atmosphere and high rate of dog ownership. You might include your dog in many facets of every day life, so why not take them when you grab a drink? These are the three best bars in Denver to take your furry friend while you grab a round.

      Dubbed "your best friend's bar,” the Watering Bowl is a dog-friendly spot housing a dogpark, bar, grill, and music venue, all in one place. Although dogs aren’t actually allowed inside of the bar, there are 7,000 additional square feet outside for a fenced-in private dog park. The Watering Bowl has a fully stocked regular bar and a wine bar on the main level, as well as another bar and two VIP lounges upstairs. Activities and events are frequent at this local bar.

      </b><br />
        With delicious locally brewed beers and a great spot on Platte Street, this is a go-to spot to take your best friend. Their IPAs and Porters are local favorites. With a 3,400 square foot interior and retracting garage doors for the warmer months, there is plenty of room for pets.
        The outdoor biergarten is where it's at, though, and the place for you and your puppy to relax with a cold pint of
        Princess Yum Yum or a Graham Cracker Porter.
